<P>Once there was a fox. He was very hungry. He went here and there in search of food. But he did not get food anywhere.
At least he reached a garden. There he saw a crow in the tree. THe crow had a piece of cheese in the break.</p>
THE FOX AND THE CROW
<p>The fox was very clever. He began to praise the crow. He said,” Dear crow! You are very beautiful. Your voice is very sweet. Please sing me a song.” The crow was taken in. He opened the beak to sing. The piece of cheese fell down. The fox ate it up and went away.</p>
